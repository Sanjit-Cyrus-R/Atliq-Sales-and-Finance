## Atliq Business Model
All throughout the world, Atliq sells its goods to various clients. They sell their goods to both online retailers like Amazon and Flipkart as well as offline distributors with real stores like Croma and so on. Customers of **Brick and Mortar** stores are those who shop in physical stores, while those who shop online are classified as **E-Commerce**. These two businesses—Brick and Motor and E-Commerce—fall under the larger **retail** category. **Direct** is the revenue channel that Atliq uses for their own E-Commerce and retail store. Additionally, there is an additional customer channel known as **Distributor**. This is because Atliq is unable to sell directly in some countries, such as China, instead they sell via the distributor.
